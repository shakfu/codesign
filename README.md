# codesign
Python3 script for signing, packaging, notarizing and stapling Apple command line binaries using `notarytool`. This script only requires Python3 and uses only standard libraries.

This script is specifically targeted at codesigning, notarizing, creating `.pkg` files and stapling the notarization onto **commandline tools** written and compiled outside of Apple Xcode. This was created specifically for notarizing and signing python tools created with PyInstaller. 

As of MacOS Catalina, all distributed binaries must be signed and notarized using an apple developer account. This account costs $99 per year. *Thieves*.

Apple's documentation for this process is ***ABSOLUTELY*** terrible. For a guide to doing this manually see [Signing_and_Notarizing_HOWTO](https://github.com/txoof/codesign/blob/main/Signing_and_Notarizing_HOWTO.md)

## NEW in v0.3
As of v0.3, this script uses `notarytool` instead of `altool`. `altool` is being deprecated by Apple and will no longer work after November 2023.

If you are updating from a previous version of `pycodesign`, you will need to create a new keychain profile and update your .ini file.

## Requirements
See [this guide](https://github.com/txoof/codesign/blob/main/Signing_and_Notarizing_HOWTO.md) for help in obtaining these requirements.
* Paid apple developer's account
* Developer ID Application certificate
* Developer ID Installer certificate

## Quick Start
1) Download [pycodesign](https://github.com/txoof/codesign/raw/main/pycodesign.tgz)
2) Unpack and place somehwere in your `$PATH`
3) Create a keychain profile for notarization using `xcrun notarytool store-credentials YOUR_PROFILE_NAME --apple-id YOUR_APPLE_ID --team-id YOUR_TEAM_ID`
    * You will be prompted for your app-specific password.
    * For more information, see [this article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3147-migrating-to-the-latest-notarization-tool#Save-credentials-in-the-keychain).
4) Enter directory containing the binaries you wish to sign
5) run: `pycodesign.py -N` to create a template configuration file
6) edit the configuration file (see [below](#configFile) for more details
7) run `pycodesign.py yourconfig.ini` to begin the signing and notarization process
8) Enter your username and password as needed to unlock your keychain
9) Once the package is submitted to Apple, `pycodesign` will wait to see if the process is complete. 
   * Check your email or manually check the notarization status using `xcrun notarytool history --keychain_profile YOUR_PROFILE_NAME`
10) rejoyce in your signed .pkg file

  -s, --sign            sign the executables, but take no further action
                        (can be combined with -p, -n, -t)

  -O <VERSION STRING>, --pkg_version <VERSION STRING>
                        overide the version number in the .ini file and use 
                        supplied version number.
